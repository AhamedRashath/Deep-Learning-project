DEEP LEARNING PROJECTS:
AUTO-MPG DATASET
It is a artificial neural network project in deep learning which contains nine columns including predictable class columns.
About Dataset
Context
The data is technical spec of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository

CONTENT:
1)Title: Auto-Mpg Data
2)Sources:
(a) Origin: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which ismaintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition.
(b) Date: July 7, 1993
3)Past Usage:

a)See 2b (above)
b)Quinlan,R. (1993). Combining Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning.

4)Relevant Information:

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed
because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The originaldataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon,to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993).
5)Number of Instances: 398
6)Number of Attributes: 9 including the class attribute
7)Attribute Information:

a) mpg: continuous
b)cylinders: multi-valued discrete
c)displacement: continuous
d)horsepower: continuous
e)weight: continuous
f)acceleration: continuous
g)model year: multi-valued discrete
h)origin: multi-valued discrete
i)car name: string (unique for each instance).
